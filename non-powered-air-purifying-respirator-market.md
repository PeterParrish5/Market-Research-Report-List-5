<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Non-Powered Air Purifying Respirator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Disposable/ Filtering Facepiece Respirators (FFR)</li><li>Reusable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Disposable/ Filtering Facepiece Respirators (FFR) are non-powered air purifying respirators that are designed for single use and are commonly used in healthcare settings to protect against airborne particles. On the other hand, reusable air purifying respirators are designed for multiple uses and can be cleaned and maintained for extended periods of time. Both types of respirators provide protection against harmful contaminants in the air, but disposable FFRs are more convenient for single-use applications while reusable respirators are cost-effective for long-term use.</p></p>
