<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Atomized Brass Powder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water Atomization</li><li>Gas Atomization</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Atomized brass powder is produced through two main methods: water atomization and gas atomization. In water atomization, molten brass is sprayed with high-pressure water jets, resulting in droplets that solidify into powder forms. Gas atomization involves using a high-pressure gas stream to break up molten brass into fine powder particles. Both methods result in high-quality brass powder with diverse applications in industries such as automotive, electronics, and aerospace. The choice between water and gas atomization depends on the specific requirements of the final product.</p></p>
