<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Laser Communication Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Transmitter</li><li>Receiver</li><li>Modulator</li><li>Demodulator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Laser communication equipment can be classified into four main types: Transmitter, Receiver, Modulator, and Demodulator. Transmitters are responsible for converting electrical signals into laser beams for transmission. Receivers receive the transmitted laser signals and convert them back into electrical signals. Modulators help in encoding information onto the laser beam, while Demodulators decode the information from the received laser signal. Each of these components plays a crucial role in ensuring efficient communication through laser technology.</p></p>
