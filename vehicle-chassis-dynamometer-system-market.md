<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vehicle Chassis Dynamometer System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Multi Roller</li><li>Single Roller</li></ul></p>
<p><p>A multi-roller chassis dynamometer system utilizes multiple rollers to apply resistance to the vehicle's wheels, providing a more accurate simulation of real-world driving conditions. This system is typically used for testing larger vehicles and those with all-wheel drive. On the other hand, a single-roller chassis dynamometer system utilizes only one roller for resistance, making it more suitable for smaller vehicles and front- or rear-wheel drive configurations. Both systems are essential tools for testing and optimizing vehicle performance and emissions.</p></p>
