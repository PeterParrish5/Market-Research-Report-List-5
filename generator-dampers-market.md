<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Generator Dampers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>All-in-one</li><li>Distributed</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Generator dampers can be classified into two main types: all-in-one dampers and distributed dampers. All-in-one dampers are designed as a single unit that controls vibrations across the entire generator. On the other hand, distributed dampers consist of multiple units that are strategically placed throughout the generator to target specific areas of vibration. Both types have their advantages and are used depending on the specific requirements of the generator and its application.</p></p>
