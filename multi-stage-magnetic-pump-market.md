<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Multi-stage Magnetic Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Stationary Shaft</li><li>Rotating Shaft</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The multi-stage magnetic pump market can be classified into two types based on the shaft position: stationary shaft and rotating shaft. In stationary shaft pumps, the shaft remains fixed while the impeller rotates around it, reducing wear and tear on the shaft. In rotating shaft pumps, the shaft rotates along with the impeller, which allows for easier maintenance and monitoring of the pump. Both types have their own advantages and are chosen based on factors such as efficiency, durability, and ease of maintenance.</p></p>
