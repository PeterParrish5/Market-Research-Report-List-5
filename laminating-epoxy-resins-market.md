<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Laminating Epoxy Resins Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Low Viscosity</li><li>High Viscosity</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Laminating epoxy resins are commonly categorized into two main types based on their viscosity: low viscosity and high viscosity. Low viscosity epoxy resins are more fluid and are typically used for applications that require easy flow and penetration into tight spaces. On the other hand, high viscosity epoxy resins are thicker and are commonly used for laminating thicker materials or for applications where a thicker coating is desired. Both types offer unique properties and are chosen based on the specific requirements of the project.</p></p>
