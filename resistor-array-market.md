<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Resistor Array Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thin Film</li><li>Thick Film</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Resistor arrays are electronic components that consist of multiple resistors in a single package. The two main types of resistor arrays are thin film and thick film. Thin film resistor arrays are made by depositing a thin layer of resistive material onto a ceramic substrate, allowing for high precision and stability. Thick film resistor arrays are created by printing a thick layer of resistive ink onto a ceramic substrate, making them more cost-effective but slightly less precise. Both types of resistor arrays are commonly used in various electronic applications for voltage division and current limiting.</p></p>
