<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Secondary Encoders Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absolute Encoders</li><li>Incremental Encoders</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Secondary encoders are commonly divided into two main types: Absolute Encoders and Incremental Encoders. Absolute Encoders provide a unique digital code for each position of the encoder shaft, allowing for precise and accurate positioning information. Incremental Encoders, on the other hand, provide relative position information by counting pulses generated as the shaft rotates. Both types have their own advantages and applications, with Absolute Encoders being favored for applications requiring high accuracy and Incremental Encoders being used for simpler positioning tasks.</p></p>
