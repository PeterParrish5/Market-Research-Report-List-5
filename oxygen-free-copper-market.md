<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Oxygen-Free Copper Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>0.9997</li><li>0.9995</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Oxygen-Free Copper (OFC) is divided into two main market types based on their purity levels: 0.9997 and 0.9995. The 0.9997 market type refers to copper with a higher purity level, containing only 0.03% oxygen or less. This high purity level makes it suitable for applications requiring exceptional conductivity and corrosion resistance. On the other hand, the 0.9995 market type has slightly lower purity, with a maximum oxygen content of 0.05%. This type is used in applications where a slightly lower level of purity is acceptable.</p></p>
