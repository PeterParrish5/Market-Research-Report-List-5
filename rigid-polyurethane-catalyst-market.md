<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rigid Polyurethane Catalyst Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-reactive Amine Catalysts</li><li>Reactive Amine Catalysts</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Rigid polyurethane catalyst market can be divided into two main types: non-reactive amine catalysts and reactive amine catalysts. Non-reactive amine catalysts act as accelerators in the curing process of polyurethane, helping to control the reaction rate. On the other hand, reactive amine catalysts not only accelerate the reaction but also become part of the final product, impacting the properties of the polyurethane. Both types play a crucial role in enhancing the performance and properties of rigid polyurethane products.</p></p>
