<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Diesel Anti-gelling Additives Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Concentrated Diesel Anti-gelling Additives</li><li>Ready-to-use Diesel Anti-gelling Additives</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Concentrated Diesel Anti-gelling Additives are products that need to be mixed with diesel fuel before use, offering a stronger solution for preventing gelling in cold temperatures. Ready-to-use Diesel Anti-gelling Additives, on the other hand, come pre-mixed and are ready for direct application to the fuel tank. Both types of additives serve the same purpose of preventing gelling in diesel fuel during winter months, but they differ in terms of convenience and ease of use.</p></p>
