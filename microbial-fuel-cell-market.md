<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Microbial Fuel Cell Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mediator Microbial Fuel Cell</li><li>Mediator-free Microbial Fuel Cell</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC) market can be classified into two types based on the presence or absence of a mediator. In Mediator Microbial Fuel Cells, a substance acts as an intermediate to transfer electrons from the microorganisms to the electrode. On the other hand, Mediator-free Microbial Fuel Cells do not require any mediator and directly transfer electrons, making them more cost-effective and environmentally friendly. Both types have their advantages and applications in various industries such as wastewater treatment, energy generation, and biosensor development.</p></p>
