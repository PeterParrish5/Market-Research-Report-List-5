<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thick Layer Photoresists Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Photoresists</li><li>Negative Photoresists</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Thick Layer Photoresists market includes two main types - Positive Photoresists and Negative Photoresists. Positive Photoresists are designed to become more soluble in the developer upon exposure to light, allowing the exposed areas to be removed during development. On the other hand, Negative Photoresists become less soluble in the developer when exposed to light, causing the unexposed areas to be removed during development. Both types play a crucial role in the semiconductor industry for patterning and transferring circuit patterns onto substrates.</p></p>
